# Claude Skills

A collection of reusable Claude Code skills for efficient project management and software design.

## Skills

### first-principles-design

First-principles approach to plugin/software design. Use when:
- Designing new plugins or features
- Evaluating feature requests
- Simplifying existing implementations

**Core principle**: "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"

### first-principles-pm

First-principles project management - from idea to execution with maximum efficiency. Use when:
- Starting new projects
- Evaluating requirements
- Managing development workflow

**Core philosophy**: "The best part is no part. The best process is no process."

## The 5-Step Algorithm

Both skills follow the same fundamental algorithm:

1. **Question** - Challenge every requirement
2. **Delete** - Remove parts and processes ruthlessly
3. **Simplify** - Optimize what remains
4. **Accelerate** - Speed up the cycle
5. **Automate** - Only after steps 1-4

## Usage
